## OCR project for the Corsican press of the interwar period

The aim is to build two models for this particular press. First, a segmentation model in order to apprehend the complex layout of those documents. Then, a recognation model that can perform on a plurilingual corpus, including the corsican language.

This repository contains a folder that consists of the XML/ALTO files following eScriptorium format. Those files originally come from the Gallica platform (Biblioth√®que nationale de France) and have been transformed thanks to a XSLT stylesheet designed by Angelo Mario Del Grosso and Federico Boschetti from the University of Venice.
